                            <p><b>New Horizons Same Promise: It’s been a
                                    while since I’ve blogged here. I’m happy to say that it’s finally
                                    time to unveil the real reason why.Redsqware has come a long way in five years.</b></p>
                            <p>It all began with a simple goal. To be an adaptive,
                                reliable technology partner for our clients and team members. After years of handling
                                development from the agency side, we realized that we’d developed a circle of partners,
                                team members, and SMEs that was a great deal more than the sum of its parts. We had
                                also proved ourselves, time and again, with more than a decade of successful technology
                                development and support on the agency side. We were trusted by people we worked with –
                                and for – because we didn’t hesitate to put their needs ahead of our own when the chips
                                were down.</p>
                            <p>And the chips were down quite often. Our clients tended to come to us with challenging
                                custom development projects that were beyond the reach of either an agency or a
                                development services company alone. To deliver on those demanding requirements, we
                                gradually built a bridge between the two. Along the way, we developed and nurtured a
                                valuable network of people, partners, and methodology from around the world. We also
                                built a stable of amazing, brilliant clients, and were lucky enough to become a trusted
                                partner for some very large multinational concerns. That wasn’t a painless process, and
                                I learned as much from our failures as from our successes. Maybe more. No matter what,
                                I’ve always believed in keeping promises. To me, upholding the trust we’d earned from
                                our staff and our clients came first. Eventually, we also learned to balance code,
                                cost, and compliance effectively – and even started turning a profit.</p>
                            <p>Creating a new company to leverage what we’d learned was just a natural extension of
                                that evolution. I felt that for any new company to be a viable enterprise in the
                                long-term, it had to be a bootstrap endeavor. Looking back, that was the smartest
                                decision we made. It forced us to evolve to better align with what our clients needed.
                                But it also meant that we had to watch as other companies burned bright and faded away
                                – or actually succeeded, in a few cases. All the while, we kept our eyes on the road in
                                front of us. Not the one they were taking. And worked. And worked. And worked.</p>
                            <p>We waded in with open source CMS development, then licensed software. Soon we were being
                                asked for mobile apps, UX, documentation, and pretty much anything else that would fit
                                under a fixed fee. The slow burn approach kept us honest, but it also required a lot of
                                my life energy. There were many times when we took a beating financially so that we
                                could make sure a client was happy. We truly used client successes as our yardstick for
                                success, rather than immediate profit.</p>
                            <p>I feel very, very privileged to have clients and team members who believe in what we do
                                at Redsqware. Every day, I’m reminded of that in some way. Because there is no secret
                                to our success. It’s all about people, and hard work. Still, I know we’ve been
                                extremely fortunate. I know that by some estimates, as many as 75% of new companies
                                fail. And yet today, we continue to narrow and sharpen our edge.</p>
                            <p>The truth is, I would not be here writing this without those amazing people, who have
                                walked with me on every step of our journey. When we need input, they never fail to
                                humble me with their generosity and sincerity. With customer feedback, employee
                                dedication, and constructive criticism. Time and again, they’ve sustained us with
                                invaluable capital, resources, and insights – and honored me with their trust.</p>
                            <p>As we once again shed our cocoon, stretch our wings, and look to new horizons, I offer
                                them my deepest gratitude.</p>
                            <p>Cheers,</p>

                                    <p class="j-details-detail-page">After more than 21 years of experience in the
                                        digital marketing and advertising industries (including some painful learning
                                        experiences in the tech startup game) I co-founded Redsqware in early 2012.
                                        Having searched at great length (and without success), we decided to just give
                                        up – and became the kickass agency development partner we'd always wanted for
                                        ourselves. Our goals were threefold: to uplift our clients, to empower our
                                        people, and to put extraordinary tools within the reach of anyone. My
                                        philosophy is that given time, quality work and great service will always rise
                                        to the top. I believe that doing right by customers and employees is always the
                                        right thing to do. I loathe chest beating of any kind, but I love innovation –
                                        and the people all around us who drive it. I believe wholeheartedly that the
                                        more open the web is, the better off we'll all eventually be. I don't have an
                                        autonomous car, but my pickup truck is old enough to drive itself. I'm a father
                                        to three amazing kids, and a husband to a wonderful woman. In my free time I
                                        can be found wandering the beaches of either coast in search of waves and new
                                        friends; or prowling the streets of Philadelphia looking for our family's next
